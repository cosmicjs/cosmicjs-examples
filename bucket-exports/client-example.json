The service resembles Path Talk’s direct messaging platform with local businesses, but incorporates its service right into the business listing search result card it shows on Google.com, which also shows you details including price level, address, map location, phone number, opening hours, ratings and reviews.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">We’ve confirmed via a Google spokesperson that this is indeed an experimental feature the company is testing, which was originally spotted by&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MattGibstein/status/570284736557543424/photo/1\" style=\"outline: 0px;\">Matt Gibstein who shared screens on Twitter</a>&nbsp;earlier today. The new experimental chat feature offers a direct text-based line of communication, in this case with a restaurant, so that you could theoretically ask if it’s currently busy, if there’s a reservation available, or menu-specific queries, for example, and receive an answer in real-time. This is the premise behind the aforementioned Path Talk, which was a service Path added to its dedicated messenger to help separate its offering from the sea of mobile messaging apps currently available.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\"><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/30/path-talk-places/\" style=\"outline: 0px;\">Path Talk’s launch last September</a>&nbsp;stemmed from its acquisition of business text message service TalkTo, and offers an overview of local businesses using the service displayed on a map screen, allowing users to see a list, including online status information, so they know which businesses they can talk to currently. The free service eliminates the need for a phone call for activities like checking for in-stock inventory, making an appointment or making reservations.</p><div style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></div><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">Google’s test service appears to offer the same conveniences, including an estimated time for response, but using listings on Google’s own extensive existing index of places. Of course, Google launching its own version of Path Talk would be bad news for the smaller company, especially if Google made this available via things like Google Maps in addition to directly in search results. It’s still very early at this stage, however, and there’s no guarantee it’ll ever become a full-fledged offering with general availability. Still, with messaging of increasing importance to businesses everywhere, it’s a smart area for the search giant to explore.</p>","metafields":[],"type_slug":"articles","created":"2015-07-29T00:23:16.179Z","user_id":"55767c3ffbcf5cbb13000001","options":{"slug_field":0,"content_editor":1,"add_metafields":0,"metafields_title":0,"metafields_key":0},"order":3},{"_id":"55b81cf4a4fa753951000006","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","slug":"tc-droidcast-episode-39-the-galaxy-s6s-six-appeal","title":"TC Droidcast Episode 39: The Galaxy S6’s ‘Six Appeal’","content":"<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">This week on the Droidcast, it’s basically the eve of the reveal of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the HTC One M9, so we get into those, including the most recent leaks, like carrier<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/22/samsung-galaxy-s6-teaser/\" style=\"outline: 0px;\">slip-ups around the S6’s ‘Six Appeal’</a>&nbsp;and the big spill of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/24/heres-the-htc-one-m9-as-revealed-in-new-leaked-videos/\" style=\"outline: 0px;\">One M9 in three videos</a>.

Subsequently, Kleiner responded that Pao’s case&nbsp;<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/13/kleiner-perkins-files-official-response-to-ellen-paos-gender-discrimination-suit/\" style=\"outline: 0px;\">has no validity</a>, and that her failure to advance at the firm was due solely to her personal and professional shortcomings as an employee.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">It was, and continues to be, an explosive and messy case, with a number of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/24/as-ellen-pao-vs-kleiner-trial-gets-underway-a-number-of-power-players-to-take-stand/techcrunch.com/2012/05/22/key-details-of-the-kleiner-perkins-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/\" style=\"outline: 0px;\">damning allegations</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/13/kleiner-perkins-files-official-response-to-ellen-paos-gender-discrimination-suit/\" style=\"outline: 0px;\">both sides</a>. And now, after many months of failed settlement negotiations and pre-trial meetings, both sides are getting their day in court. At stake is $16 million, which Pao’s legal team says represents her lost earnings as a result of the alleged gender discrimination and retaliation.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">Today in a packed courtroom at San Francisco’s Superior Court, the legal teams representing Pao and Kleiner Perkins have begun laying out their arguments in front of a 12-person jury. I’m here in the courtroom today, and TechCrunch will be reporting on the case as it plays out in the days ahead.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">The judge presiding over the case, Harold Kahn, has penciled in at least four weeks for the trial, as detailed testimony regarding the somewhat arcane financial and operational details of how venture capital firms are managed will be presented alongside the material details of the allegations at hand.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">Along with Pao, who left Kleiner&nbsp;<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/eileen-pao-is-out-at-kleiner-perkins-tells-quora-that-she-was-fired-as-discrimination-case-continues/\" style=\"outline: 0px;\">in late 2012</a>&nbsp;and is currently serving as the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/13/reddit-ceo-resigns-alexis-ohanian-returns-as-chairman/\" style=\"outline: 0px;\">interim CEO of Reddit</a>, a number of key Silicon Valley power players have been subpoenaed to testify as witnesses in the case.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">This morning, Pao’s lead attorney Alan Exelrod said that Kleiner Perkins partner Trae Vassallo will be testifying about the sexual harassment she allegedly also experienced at the firm from Ajit Nazre, the same former Kleiner partner at the center of Pao’s claims. Vassallo, who is still working at Kleiner, is set to testify as early as this afternoon, Exelrod said.</p><div style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></div><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">Meanwhile, Kleiner’s lead attorney Lynne Hermle named prominent Kleiner staffers Mary Meeker, Juliet de Baubigny, Beth Seidenberg, and Susan Biglieri as examples of people who will take the stand to testify to Kleiner’s purported gender inclusiveness. Other possible witnesses include longtime Silicon Valley and Kleiner boldfaced names including John Doerr, Ray Lane, Ted Schlein, Randy Komisar, Chi-Hua Chien, and others.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">While many in the mainstream and business press seem to be seizing on this case as a representative symbol of the difficult road that women often face in the technology industry — as Pao headed out of the courtroom today for the lunch break, a swarm of TV reporters with cameras and microphones rushed up to her, hollering out questions like “Is Silicon Valley a boy’s club?” in a manner that would be familiar to anyone who’s seen videos from TMZ — what seems to be clear to me as this has played out is that this is not just a simplistic case of women versus men. There are multiple issues at play, and it’s a sensitive situation with a number of conflicting accounts. The jury will have a challenging road ahead as it works to suss out what is true, false, right, and wrong here.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;\">Embedded below are the briefs of Ellen Pao’s complaint against Kleiner Perkins, and Kleiner Perkins’ response, respectively:</p>","metafields":[],"type_slug":"articles","created":"2015-07-29T00:23:16.180Z","user_id":"55767c3ffbcf5cbb13000001","options":{"slug_field":0,"content_editor":1,"add_metafields":0,"metafields_title":0,"metafields_key":0},"order":5},{"_id":"55b81cf4a4fa753951000008","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","slug":"footer","title":"Footer","content":"<p><br></p>","metafields":[{"edit":1,"value":"Driver Example","key":"site-title","title":"Site title","type":"text","children":false},{"edit":1,"value":2015,"key":"copyright","title":"Copyright","type":"text","children":false}],"type_slug":"global","created":"2015-07-29T00:23:16.181Z","user_id":"55767c3ffbcf5cbb13000001","options":{"slug_field":1,"content_editor":1,"add_metafields":1,"metafields_title":1,"metafields_key":1},"order":6}],"media":[{"_id":"55b81cf4a4fa753951000009","name":"0182c580-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"eso-summary_2357457k.jpg","size":195131,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-26T22:02:21.199Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf4a4fa75395100000a","name":"01833ab1-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpeg","original_name":"images.jpeg","size":5780,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-28T17:11:21.841Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf5a4fa75395100000b","name":"0182ec90-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"hubble.jpg","size":300865,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-26T22:02:21.486Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf5a4fa75395100000c","name":"01833ab0-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"blackhole-7262-7673-hd-wallpapers.jpg","size":562320,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-28T17:11:20.930Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf5a4fa75395100000d","name":"018361c2-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"tumblr_static_nebula.jpg","size":393295,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-28T17:11:31.216Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf6a4fa75395100000e","name":"018388d1-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"outer-space-1920x1200-hd-wallpaper.jpg","size":712133,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-28T17:11:43.163Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf6a4fa75395100000f","name":"018361c0-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"509233main_M33_image.jpg","size":1253814,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-28T17:11:24.304Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf7a4fa753951000010","name":"018361c1-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"Hubble_image_of_Abell_68.jpg","size":1017119,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-28T17:11:31.166Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf7a4fa753951000011","name":"018388d0-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"Galaxy.jpg","size":1512571,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-28T17:11:42.312Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf7a4fa753951000012","name":"018313a0-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"fantasy_space-wide.jpg","size":1753167,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-26T22:02:30.752Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cf7a4fa753951000013","name":"018388d2-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"fantasy_space-wide.jpg","size":1753167,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-28T17:11:45.123Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"},{"_id":"55b81cfaa4fa753951000014","name":"018388d3-3588-11e5-b8d9-0961ed8068d4.jpg","original_name":"crab-nebula.jpg","size":8634753,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"55b81cc6a4fa753951000001","created":"2015-02-28T17:12:08.588Z","folder":null,"location":"https://cosmicjs.com/uploads"}],"media_folders":null,"plugins":[]}}
